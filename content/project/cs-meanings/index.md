How do we learn the meaning of new concepts?  
Inspired by projects like [HistWords](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/), we use natural language processing techniques to model changes in word meanings during an introduction to computer science course. Our goal is to then use this model to predict changes in neural activity that occur as students learn new ideas.  

#### Methods & tools:
 
 - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Word vector embeddings (incl. [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/))
    - Deep learning language models (incl. [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert))
 - High-performance computing (HPC) (on prem)
 - [Python3](https://www.python.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) & [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
 - Functional MRI
 - Pattern analysis (MVPA)
 
This is work in progress, please check back for updates!
