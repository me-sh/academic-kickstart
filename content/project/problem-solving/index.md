{{< figure src="psolveimg.jpg" title="An unsupervised study of problem solving" numbered="false" lightbox="true" >}} 

In this **problem-solving** study, we used unsupervised learning to explore the rapid interaction between competing brain networks during complex task performance. 

#### Methods:
- Intracranial recordings
- Time-series analysis
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
