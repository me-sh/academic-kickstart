### What happens when the brain gets bored? ###

When we get bored, our brain quickly frees up processing power, keeping up task performance (so you can keep driving down the interstate) while increasingly thinking about other things (life!). Read all about it in our [Trained to Silence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811916304517) paper.

#### Methods:
 - Functional MRI (brain data)
 - Behavioral testing
 - General linear model (GLM)
