Since the beginning of history, humans were the only ones capable of producing and understanding language. In the last few years, deep learning is starting to change that. Modern language models can now chat with humans, answer questions, and more. These models are big, complex beasts (175 billion parameters in the [GPT3 model]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) ). Key to their success is their ability to **consider words in context** and **automatically focus on the important parts**, thanks to [attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).  
 
In this pilot project, we train deep learning language models to "understand" not human language, but neural signals. Our goal is to use context to improve decoding of neural activity during learning.



#### Methods & tools:
 
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Tensor2Tensor library](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor)
- [TensorFlow Research Cloud](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc) & on-prem GPU cluster
    
This is work in progress, please check back for updates!
