abstract: "A ubiquitous characteristic of human cortical networks is their tendency to rapidly change their response properties upon repetition. While this phenomenon has been amply documented using simple sensory-motor tasks, it is still unclear to what extent brain activations change on a short time scale when we are engaged in high level, complex tasks. Here, we examined this question using three types of high-level visual problems. We analyzed data from intracranial recordings performed in eight patients, focusing on the location and type of changes and on their relationship to overt behavior. Our results show significant repetition effects, manifested as signal decrease with repetition, in three different groups of electrodes: textitVisual sites, which increased their activity during stimuli presentation; textitProcessing Positive sites, which demonstrated increased activity throughout the experimental trial; and textitProcessing Negative sites, which demonstrated suppression of activity during the trial as compared to baseline. Interestingly, despite these significant repetition effects, response time remained unchanged with repetition. These findings bear directly upon our ability to interpret results aggregated across multiple repetitions of the same complex task."
