I am fascinated with **human learning** and with **machine learning**, which hold so much promise for each other. At Princeton, I develop tools for improving real-world learning using neuroimaging and computational methods. Previously, as a machine learning algorithm developer, I designed data analysis systems inspired by human cognition.
